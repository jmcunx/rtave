## rtave - Run Time Average Utility

This is a silly little utility created so I can determine
average Run Time of a job over a period of time.

To build, execute build.sh to generate a Makefile from
Makefile.template on most BSD/Linux systems and IBM AIX.
For MS-DOS, it should be rather easy to create a Makefile.

This requires [j_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) to build.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, so I came up with my own method which
is a real hack.  But works for me.
